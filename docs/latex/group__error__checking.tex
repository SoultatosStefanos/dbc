Each DBC assertion comes in three variants.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Critical variant}
Used for critical assumptions that must always be verified. Most applications do not benefit from this variant. E.\+g INVARIANT\+\_\+\+CRITICAL, REQUIRE\+\_\+\+CRITICAL, ENSURE\+\_\+\+CRITICAL.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Regular variant}
Most assertions fall in this category. Regular assumptions, whose complexity is constant should be verified like this. E.\+g INVARIANT, REQUIRE, ENSURE.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Safe variant}
This variant should be used to assert for complex assumptions, that can slow down an application. Typically useful for inline functions and checks of linear, or greater, complexities. E.\+g INVARIANT\+\_\+\+SAFE, REQUIRE\+\_\+\+SAFE, ENSURE\+\_\+\+SAFE.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Additionally each DBC assertion is overloaded, in order to provide a developer friendly error message.
