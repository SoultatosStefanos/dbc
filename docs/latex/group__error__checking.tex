DBC comes with certain compilation options to configure its assertions accross the different contracts.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{DBC\+\_\+\+ASSERT\+\_\+\+LEVEL\+\_\+\+NONE}
All assertions have no runtime effect. Precondtion, postcondition and invariants checks are turned to noops.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{DBC\+\_\+\+ASSERT\+\_\+\+LEVEL\+\_\+\+PRECONDITIONS}
Only precondition checks are monitored. Hence, the DBC\+\_\+\+REQUIRE checker is the only checker that is not turned to a noop.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{DBC\+\_\+\+ASSERT\+\_\+\+LEVEL\+\_\+\+POSTCONDITIONS}
Both preconditions and postconditions, validated with the DBC\+\_\+\+REQUIRE and DBC\+\_\+\+ENSURE macros, are monitored. Invariant checks are turned to noops.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{DBC\+\_\+\+ASSERT\+\_\+\+LEVEL\+\_\+\+INVARIANTS}
All assertions are monitored.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Additionally each DBC assertion is overloaded, in order to provide a developer friendly error message.
